# Real-Time-Gesture-Based-Number-Recognition
This project showcases the real-time detection of sign language numbers (0-9) through hand gestures. The system uses a webcam to capture hand movements and leverages MediaPipe for hand pose estimation. A trained Random Forest machine learning model then analyzes the positions of hand landmarks to predict the corresponding number accurately
